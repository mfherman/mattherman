## Contributing

Pull requests, bug fixes, and new features suggestions, are all welcome! If you have a question or suggestion, you can open a new [issue](https://github.com/mtn/cocoa-eh-hugo-theme/issues/new). Try to be as specific as possible.

For code changes:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit a changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the remote (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request on GitHub

Please keep each pull request to a single feature -- it's okay to submit multiple pull requests at a time! This makes new features easier to review and merge. For large changes, consider making an issue beforehand to discuss. This maximizes the likelihood that your change can be merged quickly and efficiently.
