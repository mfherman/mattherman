I'm a recent graduate of the [Applied Social Research M.S. program](http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/sociology/graduate/graduate-program-in-applied-social-research) at Hunter College in New York City. I'm interested in using administrative and public data to better understand the provision and delivery of social services. My coursework in the Sociology and Geography departments focused on statistical modeling, spatial data analysis, and program evaluation. I like using the [R programmng language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)).

I developed an R package called [`nycgeo`](https://nycgeo.mattherman.info) that contains spatial data files for various geographic and administrative boundaries in New York City as well as tools for working with NYC geographic data.

Prior to beginning my graduate program, I spent five years recording oral histories with [StoryCorps](https://storycorps.org/) and helped start a butcher shop and salumeria in Brooklyn, NY called [Ends Meat](https://www.endsmeatnyc.com/). I received my B.A. in American Studies from Columbia University in 2006. Check out [my resume](pdf/mh-resume.pdf) for more details.
