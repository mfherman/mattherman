I'm a Senior Analyst in the Office of Research and Analytics at the [New York City Administration for Children's Services](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/acs/about/data-analysis.page). I work on a team that uses child welfare data to produce reports, maps, charts, and tables for weekly ChildStat meetings. I have an academic background in Sociology and Geography, with a focus on statistical modeling, spatial data analysis, and research methodology. I'm interested in using administrative and public data to better understand the provision and delivery of social services.

I like using the [R programmng language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)). I'm currently developing an R package---[`nycgeo`](https://nycgeo.mattherman.info)---that contains spatial data files for various geographic and administrative boundaries in New York City as well as tools for working with NYC geographic data. I'm also a contributor to the [`tidycensus`](https://walkerke.github.io/tidycensus/) package.

Before I began working at ACS, I spent five years recording oral histories with [StoryCorps](https://storycorps.org/) and helped to open a butcher shop and salumeria called [Ends Meat](https://www.endsmeatnyc.com/). I received my B.A. in American Studies from Columbia University in 2006 and my M.S. in Applied Social Research from Hunter College in 2018. Check out [my resume](pdf/mh-resume.pdf) for more details.

I live in Brooklyn, NY with my wife, Jaime, daughter, Maya, and cats, Isabella, Chuck, and Walter. Get in touch at [mfherman@gmail.com](mailto:mfherman@gmail.com).
