Oh Hello! 

This is the GitHub repository for my personal website, [mattherman.info](http://mattherman.info).

The tools I used to make the website are [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [GitHub](https://github.com/mfherman/mattherman), and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). As someone who was essentially new to html, css, and most things web, Alison Presmanes Hill's [blogdown tutorial](https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/) was incredibly helpful in guiding my initial setup.
