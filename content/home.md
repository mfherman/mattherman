I'm a graduate student in the [Applied Social Research program](http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/sociology/graduate/graduate-program-in-applied-social-research") at Hunter College in New York City. I'm interested in using adminstrative and public data to better understand the provision and delivery of social services. My coursework in the Sociology and Geography departments has focused on statistical modelling, spatial data analysis, and program evaluation.

Currently, I'm working on a project in collaboration with the [Center for Innovation through Data Intelligence](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/cidi/about/about.page) and the NYC Department of Homeless Services that uses Natural Language Processing of homelessness prevention case notes to predict an individual's risk of shelter entry.

Prior to beginning my graduate program, I spent five years recording oral histories with [StoryCorps](https://storycorps.org/) and helped start a butcher shop and salumeria in Brooklyn, NY called [Ends Meat](https://www.endsmeatnyc.com/). I received my B.A. in American Studies from Columbia University in 2006.
